# 🧠 AI Power User Playbook

A collection of real-world strategies, tips, and patterns for making AI agents more useful and effective.

---

## 1. 🧠 Conversation Management

### 🔄 Reset vs Nudge  
Sometimes it’s better to start fresh instead of trying to guide the AI back on track.  
_“Start a new thread” > “Let me clarify”_

### ⏩ “Continue” Prompt  
When the model gets cut off mid-response, just type “continue” to resume.

---

## 2. 🔍 Prompt Comparison

### 🗂️ Multi-tab Prompting  
Open multiple browser tabs with slight variations of the same prompt to compare results side-by-side.

### ✍️ Rewrite Instead of Repeating  
Don’t argue with the AI — revise the prompt instead. Clarify, rephrase, or reframe your ask.

---

## 3. 📋 Output Formatting

### 🧱 Use Code Blocks for Clarity  
Even non-code responses benefit from markdown code blocks. It keeps lists, tables, and logic easy to read.

### 🔢 Numbered Instructions  
Break multi-step instructions into explicit numbered steps to help guide model logic.

---

## 4. 🛡️ Reducing Hallucinations

### ❗ Use Constraints like “Don’t Guess”  
Explicitly tell the model not to guess. Example:  
> “If unsure, say so. Do not guess. Only respond with what you’re confident in.”

### 📚 Ask for Sources  
Adding “Please cite your sources” or “Add references” encourages grounding and transparency.

---

## 5. 🤔 Meta Prompting

### 💡 Ask the AI to Improve Itself  
Ask: “How could this answer be clearer?” or “What did you miss?” to surface improvements.

### 🧠 Prompt the AI to Help Write Prompts  
Use the model to refine your own instructions. Example:  
> “Can you rewrite this prompt to be clearer and more specific?”
