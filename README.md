## The Problem We're Solving

Most people know how to use AI tools, but struggle to get consistently good results. The difference isn't about features or prompts - it's about invisible habits that experienced users develop through months of trial and error.

**The gap:** New users often get stuck, not because the tools are broken, but because they don't know the unspoken techniques that make AI actually useful.

**The solution:** Make this hidden knowledge accessible to everyone.

## Quick Examples

Here's a taste of some tips you'll find:

- 🗂️ Run the same prompt in 3 tabs to compare AI's natural variation
- 🔢 Break requests into numbered steps: AI follows logic better
- ❗ Add "don't guess" to any factual request → Reduces hallucinations
- 🧠 Ask "What's the goal here?" to check if AI understands your intent
