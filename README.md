*Real tactics that experienced AI users figure out through trial and error.*

Started as a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/winklerjenna_building-my-first-ai-agent-prototype-taught-activity-7359006711648509953-DBEX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABfwn64BEabFM1gqnsCfTZJjkQdEtjQj6vg) about the invisible techniques that make AI actually useful.

## The Problem

Most people know how to use AI tools but struggle to get consistent results. It's not about the tools - it's about knowing the techniques that experienced users figure out over time.

## What You'll Find

- 🗂️ Run the same prompt in 3 tabs to compare AI's natural variation
- 🔢 Break requests into numbered steps: AI follows logic better
- ❗ Add "don't guess" to any factual request → Reduces hallucinations
- 🧠 Ask "What's the goal here?" to check if AI understands your intent
