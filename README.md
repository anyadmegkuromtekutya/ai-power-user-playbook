# 🧠 The AI Power User Playbook

This is a community-driven playbook of practical strategies for using AI agents effectively — compiled from real-world experience, not product manuals.

💡 Success with AI isn’t about having the best tools. It’s about learning the hidden tricks power users figure out over time.

This project began as a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/YOUR-POST-HERE) after building my first AI agent prototype. It struck a chord — so I’m publishing this as a shared resource and evolving it in public.

## ✨ Why this exists

New users often get stuck, not because the tools are broken, but because they don’t know *how* to work with them. This playbook captures those invisible skills — workarounds, prompt patterns, and UX hacks — to make AI more usable for everyone.

## 🧰 What you'll find here

- 🔄 Reset vs continue: managing conversation context  
- 🗂️ Multi-tab prompting: comparing results  
- 🧱 Code blocks for clarity
